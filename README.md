Hello, I will be continuously working on this project, meaning its not finished. But i will keep updating along the way :)
By the end i hope to post a link so that anyone who is curious can check it out. i already can tell you there are some rough spots. the only issue was uploading images. i tried removing the
background in the photos but still ran across the same problem. 

the problem: images messed up my text and not able to shrink when the webpage got smaller. im 100% sure its the way i saved the images and howwhere in the process of creating, saving and importing 
messed up alot of styling. 

my solution: haha i had to overlay alot and hard imput positioning which caused my webpage to be able to shrink and grow. :/
